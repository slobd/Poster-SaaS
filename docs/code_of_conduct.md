# Code of conduct

## Know your navigation commands

When working with someone else, in order to optimize time, use the navigation 
commands of your editor to increase the development speed. Most code editors like VSCode and IntelliJ
have commands to type the name of the file and go there directly. In case of 
IntelliJ it is `CTRL + SHIFT + N` on Windows.
